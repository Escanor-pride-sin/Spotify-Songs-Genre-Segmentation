# Spotify Songs Genre Segmentation
# About
The "Spotify Songs Genre Segmentation" project is a data science and machine learning initiative focused on recommending songs based on similarity. The main goal is to develop a function that, given a song as input, recommends the top N most similar songs—enabling personalized music discovery.

# Project Scope
Analyze Spotify song data to understand features that characterize different music genres.
Use machine learning and similarity metrics to segment songs by genre and recommend similar tracks.
Build a recommendation function to identify and suggest songs that closely match the input selection.

# Dataset
The data used includes various audio features and metadata of Spotify songs, essential to perform segmentation and similarity analysis.

# Installation
To run this project, clone the repository and install the necessary Python libraries:

bash git clone https://github.com/Escanor-pride-sin/Spotify-Songs-Genre-Segmentation.git
cd Spotify-Songs-Genre-Segmentation
pip install -r requirements.txt
Install dependencies manually if needed (versions may vary):

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
jupyter notebook

# Usage
Open the Jupyter notebook in the repository.
Explore the data preprocessing, feature engineering, and segmentation approaches.
Use the provided recommendation function to input a song and receive top N similar song recommendations.

# Project Structure
Main Jupyter notebook with data analysis and model development.
Any data files or scripts located in appropriate folders.
Requirements file listing the dependencies.

# Results
The project produces a functioning music recommendation function based on song similarities in feature space, applied to Spotify tracks. Visualizations and cluster analyses demonstrate the genre segmentation effectiveness.

# Future Enhancements
Incorporate more advanced recommendation algorithms like collaborative filtering or deep learning.
Integrate with Spotify API for real-time song recommendations.
Expand dataset with more diverse song collections.

# Acknowledgments
This project leverages open-source Python libraries and the publicly accessible Spotify dataset. Thanks to all contributors of these tools.
